<p>I have been promising some people that this (my first) post will be “coming soon” for quite some time now. It has finally arrived and the main reasons for my slowness are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I am a slow writer. I often have all the ideas in my head, but when it comes to putting them into nice, publishable words, it has a tendency to become a bit of a slog.</p></li>
<li><p>The scope of this project was overly ambitious and expanded as I kept on branching off from the main mission in order provide additional background (when given free reign, this is my tendency).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The R code and analysis itself did not take too long, so the main areas I am looking to improve in the future are my writing efficiency and keeping the scope of my blog posts under control. However, it would feel like going against my style to avoid going down rabbit holes and off on tangents entirely, so there is still a balance to be struck there.</p>
<p>The out-of-control scope has also impacted the length of this article. I commend anyone who actually reads the whole thing, but hopefully it’s also possible to jump around and only read the parts that interest you in particular using the table of contents. I will endeavour to keep future blog posts a lot shorter going forward.</p>

<li><p>Re-worded the <a href="#most-goal-kickers">question concerning goal kickers</a> to include the words “for a team in a single game” instead of merely “in a single game”.

<section id="prelude" class="level1 page-columns page-full"><h1>Prelude</h1>
<p>Since antiquity (or at the very least living memory), sporting data has been recorded, published and analysed for almost every professional sport known to man. In the modern day of analytics and social media it has reached a point where sports statistics are constantly being recorded and opined on by teams, the press and your average punter alike.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>My beloved sport of <em>Australian Rules Football</em> (which I will henceforth refer to as “footy”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>) is no different. Indeed some have even described the AFL (Australia’s national competition) as “the most data rich sport on Earth”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, although I would suggest that certain American sports such as baseball (i.e.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlKDQqKh03Y" target="_blank">Moneyball</a>) have made far better use of their data.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;As a Western Australian this is how I define it (along with the majority of Australia) but I am aware that this term is reserved for rugby league in New South Wales and Queensland</p></li><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_mePwh_02M" target="_blank">Source</a></p></li></div></div>
<p>It is my observation that it is common for those watching or attending live footy to ask questions such as:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What is the record for the most <em>[statistical category]</em>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>When was the last time <em>[obscure event]</em> happened?</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>I believe a contributor to this is that we are emulating what we hear on the broadcast commentary. The difference is that they often have a team of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxvNk03iqKigc9NKMjWOs2NvuRFRY8xRHn" target="_blank">computer-type boffins</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> behind the scenes feeding them the answer.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;The video linked here is unfortunately clipped from an American guy who kind of missed the point a bit, but it is also the highest quality clip I could find of this brilliant piece of commentary from BT (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_JCdK4ah78" target="_blank">Brian Taylor</a> for the uninitiated).</p></li></div></div>

<p>But what are us plebeians meant to do, bereft of such luxuries?</p>

<p>If you are a footy fan this article will likely present as some mildy interesting footy facts, combined with incomprehensible techno-babble. For R users this will likely appear to be a fairly elementary data wrangling exercise, combined with a bunch of references you don’t understand. But if you are both a footy fan and an R user, it will hopefully prove to be a quite interesting read.</p>

<p>As my usual footy-going companion (Saroop) and I are both actuaries by trade, footy stats questions were flying left, right, and centre on that gloomy (though not due to the weather) Saturday night at the SCG. The questions we posed did not just vanish into the aether either, I ,with the idea of writing this article in mind, decided to record the more interesting (and doable) questions.</p>

<section id="the-fitzroy-package" class="level2 page-columns page-full"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-fitzroy-package">The <code>fitzRoy</code> Package</h2>
<p>The first step in analysing AFL data is obtaining the data (the so-called “collection” phase). Our first thought might be to search the web for publicly available AFL datasets and APIs or even scrape the data from websites such as the <a href="https://www.afl.com.au/" target="_blank">official AFL website</a>, <a href="https://www.footywire.com/" target="_blank">Footywire</a> or <a href="https://afltables.com/afl/afl_index.html" target="_blank">AFL Tables</a>. But there is a more straight-forward way.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>While most people now know Fitzroy as a trendy inner city suburb of Melbourne, filled with terraces and <a href="https://www.lunecroissanterie.com/" target="_blank">over-priced croissants</a>, it was once home<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> to the mighty (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Lions#Brisbane_Bears_absorb_Fitzroy_Football_Club's_AFL_operations,_become_Brisbane_Lions" target="_blank">and now merged out of existence</a>) Fitzroy Lions Football Club.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn10"><p><sup>10</sup>&nbsp;It is also (regrettably) the place of my birth but as a WA boy I don’t like to talk about the fact that my parents happened to be in Melbourne when I was born.</p></li></div></div>

<p>We can obtain the data we need very simply using its name-sake, the <a href="https://jimmyday12.github.io/fitzRoy/" target="_blank"><code>fitzRoy</code> R package</a>. This package abstracts away all the web scraping and API calls for us into a very helpful family of <code>fetch_*</code> functions.</p>
<p>So let’s begin by loading the <code>fitzRoy</code> package and while we’re at it, we will also load all the other packages we will be using later on.</p>

<p>When sourcing data from <code>fitzRoy</code>, it is important to follow good data collection<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> etiquette by only downloading the data you need and avoiding repeatedly downloading the same data over and over again. This prevents servers being overloaded and will mean everyone will get their data faster.</p>
<p>In keeping with this, for the purposes of this blog post, I have saved the data in a local RDS file instead of repeatedly calling the <code>fetch_*</code> functions, I use <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/readRDS.html">readRDS()</a></code>.

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The so-called <em>pipe operator</em> (<code>%&gt;%</code>) of the <a href="https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank"><code>magrittr</code></a> package has been a core staple of tidyverse since its inception but since the R core team introduced the so-called <em>native pipe</em> (<code>|&gt;</code>) to <code>base</code> R (in version <a href="https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/new-features-r410-pipe-anonymous-functions/" target="_blank">4.1</a><a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a>), this has led to a split in adoption. There are some nuances in its usage<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> but it overall behaves in a similar way to the <code>magrittr</code> pipe and has <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67633022/what-are-the-differences-between-rs-new-native-pipe-and-the-magrittr-pipe" target="_blank">less overhead (and is therefore faster)</a>. While the native pipe was initially missing some of the key features of the <code>magrittr</code> pipe, new features<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> have been added to it that (in my mind) mean that it might have even surpassed the <code>magrittr</code> pipe.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn20"><p><sup>20</sup>&nbsp;another cool thing introduced in this version of R was so-called function shorthand (<code>\()</code>), see <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/function.html">help("function")</a></code> for more details</p></li><li id="fn21"><p><sup>21</sup>&nbsp;I may even cover these in a future blog post</p></li><li id="fn22"><p><sup>22</sup>&nbsp;In R version 4.2, the <code>_</code> symbol was added as a placeholder character and in R version 4.3, extractions using the <code>$</code> symbol are now allowed</p></li></div></div>
<p>While I have tried to appease people in both the tidyverse and <code>data.table</code> camps, I will not be re-writing my code more than once with such as minor syntactic difference as the pipe I use. I will therefore be dragging all my tidyverse-using readers kicking and screaming into the R 4.1 world by adopting the native pipe (<code>|&gt;</code>) in my tidyverse code.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Note that the common RStudio shortcut, <code>Ctrl+Shift+M</code> can be changed from the <code>magrittr</code> pipe (<code>%&gt;%</code>), which is still the default, to the native pipe (<code>|&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>While inspecting the <code>results</code> we may note that certain key match-level information (e.g.&nbsp;quarter-by-quarter scores) for answering some of our <a href="#question-list">questions</a> is missing from it. As it turns out, this data is actually available on the <code>player_stats_afl_tables</code> data (one row per player per match) instead. Thus, we will opt to create a ‘flattened’ version of <code>player_stats_afl_tables</code> with all the match-level fields available to use on both datasets and discard the <code>results</code> dataset (save for some quick checks to make sure the player data ‘flattening’ worked as expected).</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the <code>player_stats_afl_tables</code> dataset to determine which fields are player-level and which are match-level.</p>

<p>One thing that our <code>match_stats_flat_*</code> dataset is currently lacking is a game ID for use as a primary key. In addition, being able to link directly to AFL tables when talking about a particular game or player would be handy.</p>
<section id="game-id-and-url" class="level3 page-columns page-full"><h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="game-id-and-url">Game ID and URL</h3>
<p>Let’s tackle the game ID by writing some functions to an ID which also conveniently lines up with the way AFL Tables game URLs work (two birds with one stone).</p>

<p>In this section I will provide my working using R for each of the <a href="#question-list">aforementioned questions</a>. Where relevant, I will figure out where the <a href="#a-concrete-example">aforementioned infamous game</a> places in the history of the AFL for that particular category.</p>
<p>The pathways I go down are only one of many permutations of stats you can look at and angles you can approach things from. The code I have written is also probably more thorough and well-presented than how I would typically do it. When I do this type of thing with no intent on publishing it, my data manipulations will generally be far more ad-hoc and expedient (I pay far less attention to reproducibility and consistent naming conventions).</p>
<section id="highest-scoring-quarter" class="level2 page-columns page-full"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="highest-scoring-quarter">Highest Scoring Quarter</h2>
<p>As listed <a href="#question-list">above</a>, our first question was:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What is the record for the highest scoring quarter?</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="callout-info">
<p>Not that there is already a <a href="https://afltables.com/afl/teams/allteams/qh.html" target="_blank">page</a> on this topic on AFL Tables, but it is a good one to start with regardless.</p>
</div>
<p>To answer this question, we will begin by creating a reshaped version of the <code>match_stats_flat_*</code> dataset that is structured around quarters.</p>

<p>The record for the highest-scoring first quarter occurred during the bloodbath of an encounter that was the Bombers’ first ever clash with the Gary Ablett Junior-led Gold Coast Suns in their inaugural season in the AFL. The Bombers came out of the blocks in a flash and mercilessly obliterated the inexperienced Gold Coast side, notching up a 93 point lead at quarter time. Interestingly, the Sun actually managed to win the second quarter as the Bombers appeared to take there foot off the gas a little to <em>only</em> win by 139 points when all was said and done.</p>

<p>From one teams’ first season, to another’s last. It is quite fitting (although a little sad) that the highest scoring second quarter was against a floundering (<a href="#the-fitzroy-package">aforementioned</a>) <code>fitzRoy</code> Football Club (to which we owe the ease with which we obtained this data) en-route to a wooden spoon in their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ykfsk0pXt9E" target="_blank">final season</a> prior to merging with Brisbane Bears to form the Brisbane Lions.</p>
<p>As I was not yet born, I do not remember the game, but on the video below, the commentator shrewdly points to a strong wind prevailing towards the Crows’ goal at the beginning of the second quarter which certainly didn’t bode well for the <em>Lions</em>.</p>

<p>The Swans’ third quarter appears in 28<sup>th</sup> position here, which is the best position it gets. The game on top, the Bombers had a very even distribution of goal-kickers and kicked 32 goals so they may appear later in our list of <a href="#individual">multiple goal kickers question</a>.</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Well this was slightly unexpected, the Bloods<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> came home like a freight train against the woeful Saints in a game that took place over 100 years ago. It is also the only quarter in AFL history that has notched up a ton. Upon seeing this, given it’s vintage, I though that perhaps the story of this game might have been lost to time but the Swans have a most <a href="https://www.sydneyswans.com.au/news/235004/slaughter-the-true-story-behind-a-record-thats-stood-for-a-century" target="_blank">insightful article</a> up on their website about it. The explanation it provides is that St Kilda were undermanned through a combination of injury and player protest on account of off-field disputes. It is safe to say that the “Bloods” showed them no mercy.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn28"><p><sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Incorrectly labelled here as “Sydney” in the table above because at the time they resided in South Melbourne (they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans#Swans_move_to_Sydney:_1982.E2.80.931984" target="_blank">relocated to Sydney in 1982</a>), they were also known as the “Bloods” prior to adopting their current <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans#Club_identity" target="_blank">Swans mascot in 1933</a> due to the number of Western Australians in the side (as a WA boy I couldn’t help mentioning this)</p></li></div></div>

<p>In the infamous game, the Swans’ third (premiership) quarter was the only one that reached the top 100 quarters of all time. The fact that no quarter was even close to the the top indicates that the Swans were very consistent through-out the game. To use a cliche, they put in a consistent four-quarter effort and I suppose the Eagles were consistent too (consistently dismal).</p>
</section></section><section id="most-goal-kickers" class="level2 page-columns page-full"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="most-goal-kickers">Most Goal-kickers</h2>
<p>Three of the <a href="#question-list">aforementioned</a> questions concern goal kickers. We can therefore write a function that can generalise our approach like we did for the previous question.</p>
<p>These questions were:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What is the record for the most individual goal kickers for a team in a single game?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What is the record for the most multiple goal kickers for a team in a single game?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What is the record for the most players kicking five or more goals for a team in a single game (i.e.&nbsp;the most “bags”)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Swans game appeared to have a rather even distribution of goal kickers in the <a href="#a-concrete-example">infamous game</a>, so it will be interesting to see where it places on the all time list in this category.</p>

<p>Four bags in one game has happened on two occasions, the most recent of which (in 1991) yet again featured the Fitzroy Lions, who were trounced by 157 points by the Hawks in North Hobart.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The list of bag-getters in this game makes for interesting reading, all were recognisable names (although one more for his family connections that his own merit). As one might expect, one of the bags was courtesy of Hawthorn spearhead Jason Duntall (6 snags), along with 7 apiece from WA boy Ben Allan<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> and the three-time premiership player Darren Jarmon. Rounding out the 4 was a contribution of 5 snags from Paul Hudson, who is the son of Tasmanian footy legend Peter Hudson (how fitting that this game was played in Tassie) who averaged more than 5 goals a game himself (an incredible feat).</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn31"><p><sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Sorry I couldn’t help myself, he was also a <a href="https://www.claremontfc.com.au/" target="_blank">Claremont Tiger</a> (up the mighty Tiges)</p></li></div></div>

<p>Two of the <a href="#question-list">questions</a> concerned clangers and disposal efficiency:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What is the record for the most clangers in a game?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What is the record for the worst disposal efficiency in a game?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These statistics (which we will define below) are more advanced and have only been recorded more recently, so we will therefore have to check which data sources to use and what years they are available for.</p>
<section id="most-clangers" class="level3 page-columns page-full"><h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="most-clangers">Most Clangers</h3>
<p>A clanger is defined as</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>an absurd or embarrassing blunder.</p>

<p>Or in more precise football statistics terms</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote page-columns page-full">

Disposal clangers are any kick or handball that directly turns the ball over to the opposition.

<p>Clanger data is available on the AFL Tables data from 1998 onwards, so we will have to make do with only recent memory.</p>

<p>A lot of the games in the top 5 are from very recent years, probably highlighting the more recent trend in teams rolling the dice more with possession (high risk, high reward) as popularised by Richmond and adopted to great success of late by the Magpies. Having spot-checked a few examples, there is also a bit of a pattern of wet weather impacting these games it would seem.</p>
<p>Also notable in the top 5 is one of three games played in Shanghai as part of the AFL’s attempt at entering into the Chinese market between 2017 and 2019. While there was some rain about, one might presume from this that the Suns and Port didn’t put on a particularly impressive display of our game on that occasion, either that or they were putting on an entertaining show with plenty of high-risk, high-reward plays. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b2gue45P4k" target="_blank">video highlights</a> appear to be reasonably exciting, so I am going to assume the latter.</p>
</section><section id="worst-disposal-efficiency" class="level3 page-columns page-full"><h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="worst-disposal-efficiency">Worst Disposal Efficiency</h3>
<p>Disposal efficiency is</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote page-columns page-full">
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>the percentage of disposals that are effective.<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn33"><p><sup>33</sup>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.championdata.com/glossary/afl" target="_blank">Source (Champion Data)</a></p></li></div></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Where effective disposal is any of:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote page-columns page-full">
<ul>
<li>Effective handball: a handball to a teammate that hits the intended target.</li>
<li>Effective Short Kick: A kick of less than 40 metres that results in the intended target retaining possession. Does not include kicks that are spoiled by the opposition.</li>
<li>Effective Long Kick: A kick of more than 40 metres to a 50/50 contest or better for the team.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn34"><p><sup>34</sup>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.championdata.com/glossary/afl" target="_blank">Source (Champion Data)</a></p></li></div></blockquote>
<p>Note how the distance of the disposal is an element of how lenient the definition of “effective” is.</p>
<p>This statistic requires our first (and only) use of the <a href="https://twitter.com/fryzigg" target="_blank">Fryzigg</a> data, as disposal efficiency is not present on the AFL Tables data. While the Fryzigg data has the full history of the AFL, disposal efficiency is missing for seasons prior to 2012 onwards. We will therefore have to make do with answering this question only for about the past decade.</p>

<p>The only game with less than 50% disposal efficiency was played in torrid conditions up in Cairns. Looking at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI4dCyLt82c" target="_blank">video highlights</a>, the players were running through puddles the whole game. I have however seen equal or worse conditions in the past so it is somewhat curious that this was the worst by such a margin. For reference, Gold Coast were very poor that year, coming second last but the Roos came in a respectable ninth position (only one win and percentage outside the top 8), this also points to them probably winning this game if has been played in more favourable conditions but they still would have missed out on finals due to the mammoth percentage of the Cats that year. The “cleanest” player on the day was Jesse Joyce, who’s 8 touches came at 75% efficiency (however it was a rather low sample size).</p>
<p>Further disjointed musings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seeing a game in 2018 is also a fun reminder of the last time the Eagles won a premiership which feels a long way off given the current predicament the club is in, in spite of their recent win against the also similarly languishing<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a> Roos last Sunday.</li>
</ul>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn35"><p><sup>35</sup>&nbsp;But far more optimistic due to a combination of Clarko (he returns from his hiatus this week) and promising talent on their list such as Harry Sheezel</p></li></div><ul>
<li><p>In the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the use of suburban grounds where the quality of the surface was subpar I am sure lead to far more games with lower disposal efficiency than this (muddy fields were far more common in those days).</p></li>
<li><p>We can’t entirely blame the players, given the conditions. Anyone who has kicked a footy around in the wet will know how much heavier and slipperier than usual it can get (it is often described as being like a bar of soap). By looking through old highlights packages of the top several games in this metric, all of them appear to have been impacted significantly by weather conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>The Fryzigg data actually has weather conditions as a field on it but it appears to be somewhat unreliable, when I cross referenced the games with match reports and highlights some of the “sunny” games turned out to be played in torrential rain.</p></li>
<li><p>I also checked which players have the highest career kicking efficiency and it appears to be mostly defenders who probably inflate their numbers by getting involved in switches of play and chipping the ball around the back line. So we have to take this kind of metric with a grain of salt, there is a certain difficulty level with executing certain types of disposal (e.g.&nbsp;a kick inside 50) that it does not fully capture.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>The Norm Smith Medal is awarded to the player who is adjudged best on ground in the AFL grand final.</p></li>
<li><p>The award is named after legendary Melbourne full forward of the 1940’s and coach of the 1950’s and 1960’s, <a href="https://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/N/Norm_Smith.html" target="_blank">Norm Smith</a>. In his decorated career, he won a total of 10 premierships, 4 as a player, 6 as coach and all for the Melbourne football club (given Melbourne have only won 13 in their history, quite a feat). At the back end of his playing career, he spent two years as captain-coach (yes that was a thing at the time) of the Fitzroy football club (here they pop up again).</p></li>
<li><p>The Norm Smith medal is usually given to a player on the winning team but very occasionally, players have managed to win the award in a losing side. This has only happened 4 out of 45 times and the last time was Eagles (and Carlton) superstar Chris Judd in 2005.</p></li>
<li><p>The Norm Smith Medal was first instituted in 1979. Prior to this, there was no official award given however the media and fans of the day had their opinions of who the best on ground was in prior grand finals. While <a href="https://themongrelpunt.com/footy-history/2020/04/30/before-the-norm-smith-best-on-ground-prior-to-1979" target="_blank">this article</a> lists some “unofficial” best on ground performances in grand finals prior to 1979, I will stick with the official list. As a Western Australian, I would have no qualms with discarding the older, exclusively Victorian seasons particularly as this data is of dubious reliability.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>As previously mentioned, Norm Smith Medal data is not available on <code>fitzRoy</code>, so we will have to scrape it with some of our own bespoke code<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>. The AFL website conveniently has a <a href="https://www.afl.com.au/stats/leaders-awards/norm-smith-medal%22" target="_blank">nice table</a>, listing all the winners since the award began in 1979. We will supplement this with data from <code>fitzRoy</code> to figure out the level of experience of each player.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn36"><p><sup>36</sup>&nbsp;This illustrates the fact that sometimes you need to stray outside of <code>fitzRoy</code> but it gives most of the footy data you could ever want.</p></li></div></div>

<p>The youngest player on the list is the inaugural winner, Wayne Harmes, who was only 19 years of age when he won the prestigious award. He is known for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6jDAtqEi50" target="_blank">legendary moment</a> during this match where, towards the end of the fourth quarter, he ran down his own (errant) kick by sliding along the ground and tapping the ball to keep it in play, sending it into the path of his team mate Ken Sheldon who ran into the open goal. The goal ended up being a decisive one as the Blues came out as victors by only 5 points.</p>

<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>The most inexperienced in terms of games played was Maurice Rioli (father of Maurice Junior who is currently plying his trade at his old man’s club), member of the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rioli_family" target="_blank">Rioli family</a> of the Tiwi Islands which has uncannily produced a plethora of great footballers and premiership players. He was the first (and arguably the greatest) Rioli to ever play in the AFL/VFL. One caveat is that while at the time he had only played 21 VFL games, he was 24 years of age and had previously played 6 years of WAFL footy<a href="#fn37" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a> for South Fremantle, so he wasn’t your typical 21 game player, he was really in his prime.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn37"><p><sup>37</sup>&nbsp;At this time (prior to a national competition), WAFL football (as well as the SANFL in South Australia) could be viewed as being at a similar level to the VFL (although VFL did benefit from having the larger population in Victoria as a talent pool). While these days, the WAFL is the tier below the AFL (like the English Championship is the to Premier League), at that time, it could instead be viewed as a competition that was the best within its own region (like Serie A is to La Liga).</p></li></div></div>

<p>To mention one last record, the margin of 171 in the <a href="#a-concrete-example">infamous game</a> is actually the equal 4<sup>th</sup> highest winning margin in a AFL/VFL game. Interestingly, the all-time record in this category comes full circle, being a game between <a href="https://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1979/061119790728.html" target="_blank">the Fitzroy Lions and the Melbourne Demons back in 1979</a>. Fittingly, the victor of this game, was our friends (for whom we owe the greatest gratitude for helping us import data), the mighty <code>fitzRoy</code> footy club by a whopping 190 points. So while they had their trials and tribulations as a club (some of which we have covered in this post), it is nice to finish with them on a high note.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Interestingly, the <a href="#a-concrete-example">aforementioned infamous game</a> isn’t the record-holder (or even in the top 5) for any of our <a href="#question-list">questions</a><a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> but it is only one of 31 games where a team has scored 200 points or more which is notable enough I think, particularly given I had the (mis-)fortune of witnessing such a rare event in the flesh. Perhaps we could dig deeper to find a record it holds (every game is uniquely remarkable in some way if you look hard enough) but I somehow find more satisfaction in it being a thought-provoking enough game to coax these questions out of us without it ever being the <em>answer</em>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn38"><p><sup>38</sup>&nbsp;the closest it came was in the most multiple goal kickers category at equal 7<sup>th</sup></p></li></div></div>

<p>I will conclude by listing some people who are doing interesting work with AFL stats (often with heavy use of R and the <code>fitzRoy</code> package) to provide further motivation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/jimmyday12/fitzRoy"><code>fitzRoy</code></a>: as outlined in this article, this R package is the de facto way of sourcing AFL data.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/uselessaflstats" target="_blank">Useless AFL Stats</a>: a Facebook page which shares always interesting, sometimes abstract and often amusing AFL stats content. <a href="https://twitter.com/crow_data_sci" target="_blank">Liam Crow</a> is their data scientist and posts some interesting content of his own on his website: <a href="https://www.crowdatascience.com" target="_blank">https://www.crowdatascience.com</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://squiggle.com.au/leaderboard/" target="_blank">squiggle.com.au</a>: displays a bunch of people’s data-driven tipping models, many of which have websites and social media accounts where they do AFL stats.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jaiden_popowski" target="_blank">Jaiden Popowski</a>: is prominent in the <a href="https://fantasy.afl.com.au/" target="_blank">AFL Fantasy</a> community for the interesting data-driven analysis he produces.</p></li>
