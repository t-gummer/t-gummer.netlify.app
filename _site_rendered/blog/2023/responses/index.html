<p>Thanks for your detailed feedback on my article. I appreciate the time and effort you put into it and I have addressed a number of your points.</p>
<p>The general theme (with some exceptions) below is that I typically have fixed up spelling, grammar and punctuation errors but have left what I would (subjectively) describe as “intentional design choices” as they are.</p>

<p>toggling reader mode (on desktop) simply collapses (and enables the ability to expand/collapse) the contents tab on the left. if it were to flatten formatting and widen the bounding box to use more screen real estate (as reader modes typically do) as it stands the feature is pointless and likely a stock bit of a package added as a “why not”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah I think its a bit pointless too, I was just playing around with all the options I could include. Removed.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>comments section is both not on the contents tab and requires a sign in from a different website, though likely one your readership is likely to have. this is a recipe for 0 feedback. i would have liked to post this entire text document publically and anonymously, and was denied this pleasure. rectify this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Add the comments section to the table of contents. Have to use some sort of login as this is a static site (no backend sever/databases are possible)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>text used for hyperlinks is not indexed in the search bar (search “boffins” to check this), neither is text in footnotes (search “gadget”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can’t do much about this, I too would like my footnotes to show up because such words are indeed fun but alas.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>conversational tone taken throughout has divested your good sense on where to place commas, this will make up the bulk of adjustments. writing style leaves something to be desired but will endeavour to avoid correcting this, we know you have your ways. most of the comma-based corrections will place the comma inside the example text, while wording corrections will explain their placement outside the quotation to preserve easy <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>f</kbd>-ing</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Love a conversational tone. It is what a lot of people have remarked that they liked about it.</p></li>
<li><p>However the placement of commas is important (I do it by guessing mostly).</p></li>
<li><p>I think the writing style doesn’t leave “something to be desired”, it is optimally desirable for me. But I would be open to specific examples where you think it could be improved, there is no need to refrain.</p></li>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>though this article has been out for a couple of weeks, it’d be good if you could implement at least some of these changes while it is the only one present on your website. unfortunately, you only get one chance at a first impression, and that time is long past. judging by the views on the BT clip you shared, this article was read (or shared with) by about 10 people, 11 including me. i believe greater readership is possible.</p>

<p>More viewers than this according to analytics, the YouTube clicks aren’t the best measure because most people wouldn’t bother to click on them.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>adjust the tone of the foreword marked “apologies for the delay” from apologetic to those who you have promised this work, to informing/warning the prospective reader of your particular idiosyncracies (if it is to be preserved at all). starting your first ever post with an apology for (not) writing it (well enough) is rarely a winning strategy. easiest way to do this is simply remove the heading and first two lines and simply call this a mission statement or reflection or examen or whatever you like. perhaps place it at the end of the article too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I previously had it later on but it felt like it killed the flow of the article. Perhaps I can add it to the end somewhere but it might be a bit weird.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I often have all the ideas in my head, but when it comes to putting them into nice, publishable words, it becomes a bit of a slog.” add comma + becomes. consider rewriting this. “nice, publishable words” is good but should be slotted into a better sentence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Added the comma (I must admit I have no idea when a comma should be added before a ‘but’). However, I have not rewritten it.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“I commend anyone who actually reads the whole thing, but hopefully it’s also possible to jump around and only read the parts that interest you in particular using the table of contents.” added comma + it’s (“it’s” is short for “it is” whereas “its” is possessive, think about it in terms of the words “he’s” vs.&nbsp;“his” rather than the proper nouns that cause this confusion (“Tim’s” is not short for “Tim is”))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amended (punctuation is not my friend).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“1 As a Western Australian this is how I define it (along with the majority of Australia) but I am aware that this term is reserved for rugby league in New South Wales and Queensland” footnotes in articles by convention are short and to the point and are typically used for references, if you have much to say it ought to be in the main body of the article or removed entirely. amend this for brevity and more earnest cruelty for easterners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verbose footnotes are a key feature of the style I am going for this article. Call me a maverick if you like but this is a convention I simply refuse to conform to!</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>““the most data rich sport on Earth”2,” should be a hyperlink</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I’ll stick with the footnote but I will admit there is some inconsistency with how I approach referring to external sources. Going back to your previous note I would have though this would be a more appropriate use of a footnote than my other uses anyway.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“But what are us plebeians meant to do, bereft of such luxuries you might ask?” why is this quoted? remove the quotation formatting or “you might ask” from the end of this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Placed the “you might” ask outside of the quotes.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The more savvy among us may find answers to slightly more edifying questions by performing pro gamer moves such as:” end with a colon or emdash (lol) to avoid colonspam, also too many qualifiers in one sentence, remove either “may” or “slightly”, what this article needs is a strong leader</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn’t an emdash used as a substitute for brackets —like so—? I’ve chucked a colon in there.</p>
<p>Nice peep show reference.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>““What is the most disposals Zac Dawson had in a game”7;” text within quotation marks should start capitalised, and added an s to “disposals”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks, fixed.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>““what is the record for the longest distance run in a game”.8” same as previous, also footnote should be hyperlinked for parity with previous, if possible. add a full stop too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fixed the capitalisation, I can’t hyperlink this one unfortunately but have attached a screenshot you can hover over and see.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“but some questions will still go unanswered.” this should be a new sentence, reading something like “Even so, the most complex questions will still go unanswered.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this, thanks (I worded it slightly differently but really like the “even so,”)</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>would like to see some text early on framing the article more directly attempting to place this outlier of a game into the context of the full history of afl stats. from reading the whole thing this is obvious but it would be good to have that formalised early on, as well as the term “infamous game” used throughout to refer to the syd vs.&nbsp;wce game. add this in either the question list or concrete example sections</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good point but at this point I think it probably wouldn’t be worth rewriting. However, I will consider this as a general principal for future reference.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“However, if you are a gadget-type operator9 like myself,” style guides will tell you to never start a sentence with “however”, these style guides are irrelevant nonsense. you do need a comma though</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks! This is actually very encouraging.</p>
<p>Incidentally where should however be used if not at the beginning of a sentence?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“9 My footy tipping username is Gadget-type Operator and I often use other BT quotes for my username on other (even non-footy-related) accounts” hyperlinked the same video in both BT referencing footnotes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I put other inside the hyperlink to emphasise that I was linking to other quotes that were not that one.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“There are, of course, a multitude of tools and approaches to this, but in this post, I will be using R (my preferred programming language).” commas, for flavour</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, I’ll go with that. But I also thought you hated flavour!</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Target Audience Unclear” you said it fella. this section is quoted erroneously, and should probably should be put in place of/be incorporated into the “apologies for the delay” section</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Removed the quotes but not going to both moving it to the top. To be honest I kind of use quotes in some places purely because I like the look of them.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“If we also consider that my usual footy-going companion (Saroop) and I are both actuaries by trade, it is safe to say that footy stats questions were flying left, right and centre on that gloomy (but not because of the weather) Saturday night at the SCG. The questions we posed did not just vanish into the aether either, I (with the idea of writing this article in mind) decided to record the more interesting (and doable) questions” some stylistic and readability suggestions - remove “if we also consider that” and replace with “as”, add “as pictured” or “pictured, right” to (Saroop), add an oxford comma to “left, right, and centre”, remove “it is safe to say that” and replace with “the”, replace “but not because of” with “though not due to”, remove the brackets around (with the idea of writing…) and add a comma beforehand instead, good usage of the archaic form of “aether”, no change</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you a fan of the Oxford comma? I did find this sentence a bit difficult to write and rewrote it a few times and was never quite happy with it. Have tried to implement what you have said as best I can. Although I like (and kind of miss) “if we also consider”.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Disclaimer on the asterisk” section entirely defeats the point of an asterisk, place the explanation in the side panel with the footnotes (significantly shortened), or it its current position (slightly shortened), whatever you choose to do, the line “I have put an asterisk next to…” must be removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I initially adopted this approach but as it requires a more detailed explanation involving bullet points (which I have discovered don’t work well with footnotes), I went for a callout box instead.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The first step in analysing AFL data is obtaining the data (the so-called”collection” phase). Our first thought…” repetition of the word “first” here is inadvisable, try “Before any analysis can take place, we must obtain the data we wish to work with” etc. etc. as you have begun the technical phase of the article you have taken on the tone of a tutorial rather than a conversation as previously, perhaps unconsiously, as if you expect the prospective reader to follow along. this is fine but should be done carefully and consistently, have a reread of these sections yourself to ensure this tone is maintained throughout sections where it ought to (we and our instead of i and my for example)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah I think I did slip into a bit of a change of tone when I stated talking about technical things but I don’t really want to change it at this point.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“10 It is also (regrettably) the place of my birth but as a WA boy I don’t like to talk about the fact that my parents happened to be in Melbourne when I was born.” weird footnote just get rid of it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nah keeping it.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>would like to note that i was the 1000th view on the fitzroy lions anthem video</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice, did you comment about it like people commenting “first” on YouTube videos.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“fitzRoy R package” add a hyperlink to the documentation to the first usage of this and include the author/group’s name in that line</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah I like it, changed.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“fitzRoy provides access to a number of footy data sources11…” could also be a hyperlink</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leaving this one I think its fine.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“12 Centre bounce attendances (CBAs) are a commonly-used metrics in AFL fantasy, coaches often look at tools such as this one to help with researching their trades.” remove s from “metrics”, change “coaches” to more generic terminology like “participants” (not participants specifically, that’s rubbish) or add the prefix “fantasy” to ensure such people are not confused with real actual coaches, no, i don’t care that the word before the comma is “fantasy”, you’re ostensibly writing this for data autists, footy fans or both, and only the both group will know implicitly what you mean. best rule of article writing is to assume your audience is retarded while constantly reassuring them that they’re hugely intelligent for being able to comprehend what you’re saying, they’ll never notice the condescension</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks! Fixed these.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Data Sources Table” - stick with me here:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>clicking a column to sort the table twice should return the table to its original, unsorted state. currently there is no way to do this other than to refresh the page. paradoxically, the table is sorted in what appears to be a random order (almost certainly the order in which the data was entered into the table) and should instead be organised by one of the metrics of the columns by default (probably the data sources alphabetically). the first of these doesn’t actually matter and just annoys me, so implementing just the second should be enough</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah can’t do much about the double click thing as it is just the library I was using. However it is logical to start it in alphabetical order so I have done so.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>when expanding the rows in the data source column, an extra row expands, granting further detail on what data the fitzRoy package calls. my question is, what is the “unqiue” column? why does it ruin the symmetry and cleanliness of this otherwise lovely table? the addition of a thick, ugly slide bar to 2 out of 5 rows is not worth the additional links, which could easily be footnotes or ommitted? why is “unique” misspelt?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah I agree, I thought about changing it when I saw it but just wanted to get the article out (I wrote it out of order and that was one of the last bits I did).</p>
<p><em>Unique</em> is misspelt because I can’t spell or type properly.</p>
<p>Also thanks for calling my table “otherwise lovely”, I’m blushing.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>row “Squiggle”, column “Speed of Fetch” rollover pop-up text: “indended to be slow” - was this indendional?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“…I use readRDS().” put this in brackets, or explain it more in a footnote (why? what is it? why should i care?), or get rid of it. probably the first one. also it’s a hyperlink, but isn’t orange? more on that later</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have re-written the sentence a bit, it didn’t need brackets, it was just poorly worded (grammatically).</p>
<p>R users would know what it is and why they should care.</p>
<p>It is not orange because it is formatted as it is generated by a feature that automatically links functions (if formatted as code) to their documentation but in some cases I link them elsewhere if I am not happy with this, I might be able to change that behaviour but it would require fiddling with my custom CSS some more and for now I think it’s fine.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“16 Note that I have not written a base R dataframes version because I can see arguments for using both tidyverse and data.table but base R data.frames will probably cause more pain than they are worth (there is a reason that tidyverse and data.table exist)” added a comma, while this is already an unwieldy footnote, you have alluded to a third, inferior method to achieve your goals without explaining how it is inferior. should make it snappier or remove it, could change this sentence to something like “16 could also write this as a base r dataframes version, but trust me, it’s not worth it”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where is the comma?</p>
<p>Again R users would understand what I was talking about (it will make the code less efficient and more verbose and clunky).</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>more general advice than specific but there’s a lot of “I have” and “I will” from this point forward. could shift some words around to feel less diaristic and repetitive</p>

<p>Indeed I was kind of almost telling myself that I would write this or that later when I wrote those parts. I see the point but I’ll keep it as it is because its more effort than its worth to change.</p>

<p>“However this is add the _tb suffix18 to distinguish it from the data.table code.” i do not believe you had a proofreader besides me</p>

<p>Don’t be snarky, its very easy to glaze over things like that. I assure you, there were a lot of things I fixed before it reached your eyes!</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The so-called pipe operator (%&gt; %) of the magrittr package has been a core staple of tidyverse since its inception, but since the R core team introduced the so-called native pipe (|&gt; ) to base R (in version 4.120), this has led to a split in adoption.” added comma</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“20 another cool thing introduced in this version of R was so-called function shorthand (()), see help(”function”) for more details” hyperlink in this footnote is not orange. need more formatting consistency. if you’d like to check your hyperlinks in future, easy way to do this is create a blank bookmark in chrome and paste this bit of javascript in as the URL (or write your own, since you can do that): <code>javascript:(function(){for(i=0;i&lt;document.links.length;i++)document.links[i].style.backgroundColor='#ffff00';})();</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have mentioned this before, I don’t mind this inconsistency, it makes sense to me.</p>
<p>But that is pretty cool, how did you learn Javascript? That isn’t a very optimal way of doing it I don’t think and it also would interact weirdly with dark mode, I think just using CSS would be cleaner.</p>
<p>I kind of want to play around with the code though, although I often get frustrated whenever I have to add JS to something, I never managed to get it to run properly on the first or even the 10<sup>th</sup> attempt half the time.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Note that the common RStudio shortcut, Ctrl+Shift+M can be changed from the magrittr pipe (%&gt; %), which is still the default, to the native pipe (|&gt; ).” why is this quoted?</p>

<p>Probably didn’t need to be.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the “webscraping package” section could be put with the fitzRoy section, no reason to bury the lede, ’specially since you’ve got a hyperlink back to that section in this one anyway</p>

<p>Not an error, as I stated above. Henceforth I will mark my response to these erroneously labelled error with “output verification non-error”.</p>

<p>Ahh thank you, fixed!</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>in the “match stats” and “player stats” sections, the outputted tables are horrific to behold. look at those sliders? the player stats one can barely be displayed and needs TEN (10) numerically notarised pages, each displaying five of forty six rows? the unedited variable names for column labels? bursting at the seams they are. these appear automatically generated and really should not be tables at all. though i understand the wish to avoid tabspam, it would be advisable to put them in the spreadsheet-esque format and hide the output in tabs as you did earlier in the document for readability’s sake at the very least</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm interesting idea, I think I will leave it as is. The point is to illustrate what data is available, not to present it nicely so its meant to have those kinds of titles. I think it sufficiently serves the purpose of showing you what is available.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Not that there is already a page on this topic on AFL Tables, but it is a good one to start with regardless.” “Note”, not “Not”. also it was very kind of you to avoid “irregardless”</p>

<p>You know I haven’t used “irregardless” in like 5 years right?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>you probably don’t need to hyperlink back to the questions every time you mention them, wikipedia only does it for the first usage so why shouldn’t you</p>

<p>Because I don’t like the fact that wikipedia does that, I want to be able to go back to it at any point in the article.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>another bit of general advice that will need fixing in almost all cases, table column headings are frequently too small to display their labels pleasantly, good example is every usage of “opposition” in a table has just the “n” on a new line. very nasty. additionally table headings are wrapped to either the left or right of their bounding boxes, appearing to be entirely at random. tables need to be individually wrangled with for aesthetics whenever they are used, since aesthetics is readability and readability is everything. good reason not to use them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah I agree it isn’t ideal, I have fixed the opposition one, but more finessing than this feels like its more than its worth for me (it is a rather manual process).. The alignment is perfectly logical, numerical data is right aligned and text data is left aligned (as they both should be respectively).</p>
<p>Overall I find the tables quite readable but maybe that’s just me.</p>

<p>Noticed the “its” while reading the quote you provided (seems like I am learning).</p>
<p>Fixed both “its” and “thought” (that was a tricky pickup, thanks!)</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“In the infamous game, the Swans’ third (premiership) quarter was the only one that reached the top 100 quarters of all time.” usage of the word “premiership” is confusing to the casual reader (me). premiership means grand final, but this game was in round 15??? use a synonym</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third quarter is often known as the “premiership quarter”, some believe it is the quarter that is most important for a team’s winning chances, perhaps because it comes after half time, where a coach has the opportunity to address his players for an extended time and instruct them on adapting to the opposition’s tactics.</p>
<p>I have added a footnote with a hyperlink to prevent confusion.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The fact that no quarter was even close to the the top indicates that the Swans were very consistent through-out the game. To use a cliche, they put in a consistent four-quarter effort and I suppose the Eagles were consistent too (consistently dismal).” torturous</p>

<p>Yeah I know, it would seem the footnote messes witht he quote formatting, not much I can do.</p>

<p>Because in this case the team I was targeting in this case was West Coast instead of Sydney because they were the ones who played poorly. I think this section showed that it takes two to tango and in fact a little extra help from the elements in most cases as well.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Oh no who’s versus whose (I don’t reckon I will ever learn this one, I suppose whose being of possession makes sense but whatever happened to the apostrophe of possession)</p>
<p>I’m keeping “however it was” because I see nothing wrong with it, albeit I do like the word “albeit”</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Seeing a game in 2018 is also a fun reminder of the last time the Eagles won a premiership, which feels a long way off given…” added comma</p>

<p>I think in this case I split a sentence in two thinking it was too long but I know now to trust my instinct and to always write long sentences and seldom use full stops (thanks!).</p>
<p>Lol you and your commas, fine.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“The Norm Smith Medal was first instituted in 1979. Prior to this, there was no official award given, however the media and fans of the day had their opinions of who the best on ground was in prior grand finals.” added comma, would change “however” to “though”</p>

<p>Kept “however”.</p>
<p>Added comma.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">

</blockquote>
<p>I’m trying to buck the trend of low attention spans I suppose, we’ll see if it pays off.</p>
<p>And yes 66 minutes is a rather inaccurate estimate but I kind of like how high it is, feels like it reflects the amount of time I put into it (although one could also use a certain Mark Twain quote to rebuke me here)</p>
