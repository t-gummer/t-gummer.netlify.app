          This page is a collation of my goals (prospective) and achievements (retrospective). The purpose is to be something of a reminder of both how far I have come and what I am working towards. My vague cutoff is from my university days onwards.

<p>I would also like to emphasise the non-linearity and compounding nature of personal progress. As such, I have also included some <em>roadblocks</em> and <em>failures</em> I have experience along the way.</p>
<p>This is my attempt to run counter to what one might see on a resume or social media (predominately successes and seldom failures). I am also doing this as a reminder that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all ventures succeed (and this is okay).</li>
<li>It is from failures that we often learn the most.</li>
<li>Without risking failure, we will never dare to do anything bold.</li>

<p>The tables below are split into tabs by category (Study, Professional, Personal Projects and Extracurricular). Each table row is a different ‚Äúproject‚Äù. Click the arrow to the left of each row, to expand each project into a table with my goals. If the ‚Äúüñ±‚Äù Ô∏èsymbol appears in a cell, then it has a tooltip which you can view by hovering over it with your mouse.</p>
