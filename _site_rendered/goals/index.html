<p>I would also like to emphasise the non-linearity and compounding nature of personal progress. As such, I have also included some <em>roadblocks</em> and <em>failures</em> I have experience along the way.</p>
<p>This is my attempt to run counter to what one might see on a resume or social media (successes only). I am also doing this as a reminder that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all ventures succeed (and this is okay).</li>
<li>It is from failures that we often learn the most.</li>
<li>Without risking failure, we will never dare to do anything bold.</li>
