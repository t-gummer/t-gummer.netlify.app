    "text": "Since antiquity (or at the very least living memory), sporting data have been recorded, published and analysed for almost every professional sport known to man. In the modern day of analytics and social media it has reached a point where sports statistics have been recorded and opined on by teams, the press and your average punter alike.\nMy beloved sport of Australian Rules Football (which I will henceforth refer to as “footy”1), is no different. Indeed some have even described the AFL (Australia’s nation competition) as “the most data rich sport on Earth”2, although I would suggest that certain American sports such as baseball (i.e. Moneyball) have made far better use of their data.1 As a Western Australian this is how I define it (along with the majority of Australia) but I am aware that this term is reserved for rugby league in New South Whales and Queensland2 Source: Vice\nIt is my observation that it is common for those watching or attending live footy to ask questions such as:\n\nWhat is record for the most [statistical category]?\n\nor\n\nWhen was the last time [obscure event] happened?\n\nI beleive a contributer to this is that we are emulating what we hear on the broadcast commentary. The difference is that they often have a team of computer-type boffins3 behind the scenes feeding them the answer.3 The video linked here is unfortunately clipped from an American guy who kind of missed the point a bit, but it is also the highest quality clip I could find of this brilliant piece of commentary from BT (Brian Taylor for the uninitiated).\n\nBut what are us plebeians meant to do, bereft of such luxuries you might ask?\n\nWell, a quick Google search will make short work of questions of a more trivial nature such as “which player has kicked the most goals”4 or “which team has won the most premierships”5. The more savvy among us may find answers to slightly more edifying questions by performing pro gamer moves such as4 Tony Lockett on 13605 Carlton and Essendon tied on 16\n\nTrawling through more obscure websites such as AFL Tables to answer things liek “what is the most disposal Zac Dawson had in a game”6; or\nDigging into the deep recesses of the AFL Live App to answer questions like “what is the record for the longest distance run in a game”7\n\n6 19, versus Melbourne in round 10 20097 Tom Scully, 18.9 KMbut some questions will still go unanswered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever if you are a gadget-type operator8 like myself, you will expand the number of footy stats questions you can answer immensely by accessing and manipulating the raw data yourself. There are of course a multitude tools and approaches to this but in this post, I will be using R ( my preferred programming language).8 My footy tipping username is Gadget-type Operator and I often use other BT quotes for my username on other (even non-footy-related) accounts\n\nI recently had the misfortune (as a West Coast fan) of attending a game live between the Sydney Swans and (not so) mighty West Coast Eagles with the following scoreline:\n\nIn one-sided games like this, it seems to me that footy stats questions become more common than usual for two key reasons:\n\nIt adds something interesting to a game that otherwise lacks excitment\nThese games are often filled large statistical feats that might be close to records\n\nIf we also consider that it was two actuaries talking, it is safe to say that footy stats questions were flying left, right and center on that gloomy (but not because of the weather) Saturday night at the SCG. The questions we posed did not just vanish into the ether either, I (with the idea of writing this article in mind) decided to record the more interesting (and doable) question listed below:\n\n\nWhat is the record for the highest scoring quarter?\nWhat is the record for the most individual goal kickers in a single game?\nWhat is the record for the most multiple goal kickers in a single game?\nWhat is the record for the most 5+ goal kickers in a single game (i.e. the most bags)?\nWhere does the aforementioned game rank among the most one-sided games?\nWhat is the record for the most clangers in a game?\nWhat is the record for the worst disposal efficiency in a game by a player?\nHas anyone won a Norm smith in their first season in the AFL?\nWhat is the record for the most unanswered goals in a game?*\nWhat is the school with the most AFL players on their list?*\nWhat city/town has the most AFL players relative to population?*\nWhich player has the best goals to behinds ratio?*\nHave there ever been any undefeated seasons?*\nWhat is the worst win-lost record to make finals?*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer on the asterisk\n\n\n\nI have put an asterisk questions cannot easily be answered by the methods I discuss below and others are too lengthy for this blog post9. The remaining questions will be tackled using R below.\n\n\n9 These may get get their own blog post in the future.If you aren’t interested in the code but what really interests you is the answer, you can jump ahead to by clicking here."

Our first thought might be to search the web for publicly available AFL datasets and apis or even scrape the data from websites such as the official AFL website, Footywire or AFL Tables. But there is a more straight-forward way.\nWhile most people now know Fitzroy as a trendy inner city suburb of Melbourne, filled with terraces and over-priced croissants, it was once home10 to the mighty (and now merged out of existence) Fitzroy Lions Football Club.10 It is also (regrettably) the place of my birth but as a WA boy I don’t like to talk about the fact that my parents happened to be in Melbourne when I was born.\n\n\n\n\nWe can obtain the data we need very simply using ts name-sake, the fitzRoy R package. It abstracts away all the web scraping and api calls for us into a very helpful family of fetch_* functions.\nSo let’s begin by loading the package.\n\nlibrary(fitzRoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nfitzRoy Data Sources (WORK IN PROGRESS)\nGo into data sources and what you would use each for.

    "text": "Finicky Details About Other R Packages\nTidyverse versus data.table\n\nIn the R community, there is an ongoing power struggle between using the Posit12-backed (tidyverse)[https://www.tidyverse.org/] and the ever-potent data.table. As to make more people comfortable.12 formally known as RStudio (RIP)\nAs to not unsettle people who prefer either dplyr (and the tidyverse) or data.table, I have written code in both packages as to not alienate anyone13. Where relevant, I have used a tabbed layout to allow the reader to see both for their convenience. As my personal preference for readability is the tidyverse, I will place this code in the first tab,13 note that I have not written a base R dataframes version because I can see arguments for using both tidyverse and data.table but no reason at all to use base R dataframes\n\n\nTidyverse\ndata.table\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nplayer_stats_afltables_tb &lt;- as_tibble(player_stats_afltables)\nresults_afltables_tb &lt;- as_tibble(results_afltables)\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(data.table)\nplayer_stats_afltables_dt &lt;- as.data.table(player_stats_afltables)\nresults_afltables_dt &lt;- as.data.table(results_afltables)\n\n\n\n\nAdoption of the Native Pipe Operator (|&gt;)\nThe so-called pipe operator (%&gt;%) of the magrittr has been a core staple of tidyverse since its inception but since the R core team the a so-called native pipe was added to base R (|&gt;) (in version 4.114), this has lead to a split in adoption. There are some nuances in its usage15 but it overall behaves in a similar way to the magrittr pipe and has less overhead (and is therefore faster). The native pipe was initially missing some of the key features of the magrittr pipe, new features16 have been added to it that (in my mind) mean that it might have even surpassed the magrittr pipe.14 another cool thing introduced in this version of R was15 I may even cover these in a future blog post\n\nIn R version 4.2, _ was added as a placeholder character\nIn R version 4.3, extractions using the $ symbol are now allowed\n\n\n\nWhile I have tried to appease people in both the tidyverse and data.table camps, I will not be re-writing my code more than once with such as minor syntactic difference as the pipe I use. I will therefore be dragging all my tidyverse-using readers kicking and screaming into the R 4.1 world by adopting the native pipe (|&gt;) in my tidyverse code.\n\nNote that the common shortcut Ctrl+Shift+M can be changed from the magrittr pipe (%&gt;%), which is still the default, to the native pipe (|&gt;).\n\nWebscraping package\nWhile the majority of our data will be sources using the fitzRoy package, a small amount of data (namely Norm Smith medalists) which is outside of the scope of fitzRoy will require us to perform some bespoke web scraping. This will be performed using the rvest package."
