The purpose is to be something of a reminder of both how far I have come and what I am working towards. My vague cutoff is from my university days onwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-linearity\n\n\n\nI would also like to emphasise the non-linearity and compounding nature of personal progress. As such, I have also included some roadblocks and failures I have experience along the way.\nThis is my attempt to run counter to what one might see on a resume or social media (successes only). I am also doing this as a reminder that:\n\nNot all ventures succeed (and this is okay).\nIt is from failures that we often learn the most.\nWithout risking failure, we will never dare to do anything bold."
