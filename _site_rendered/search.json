It uses the beautiful Awesome CV template which I previously used in pure \\(\\LaTeX\\).1¬†Note that the linked YouTube video does not use Excel but I do.\nSharing\nIt is currently in a private repository on GitHub as it has some private information in it. There is also a visually consistent template for writing (cover) letters as well. I am happy to share the code with anyone who is interested. It probably is best suited to those familiar with \\(\\LaTeX\\), R and Excel2.2¬†I am not sure how large the intersection between these skill sets is but I personally find the workflow and resulting look very satisfying.\nIn the future I may make a clean template in a public repository to share with an accompanying blog post on how to use the template."
