## Colophon

> How the CV(ausage) is made.

My resume was built in a ["data-driven"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMlRAiQUdD8){target="_blank"} fashion using the [`vitae`](https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae/){target="_blank"} R package and Excel[^1]. It uses the beautiful [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV){target="_blank"} template which I previously used in pure $\LaTeX$.

### Sharing

It is currently in a private repository on GitHub as it has some private information in it. There is also a visually consistent template for writing (cover) letters as well. I am happy to share the code with anyone who is interested. It probably is best suited to those familiar with $\LaTeX$, R and Excel[^2].

In the future I may make a clean template in a public repository to share with an accompanying blog post on how to use the template.

[^1]: Note that the [linked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMlRAiQUdD8){target="_blank"} YouTube video does not use Excel but I do.

[^2]: I am not sure how large the intersection between these skill sets is but I personally find the workflow and resulting look very satisfying.
