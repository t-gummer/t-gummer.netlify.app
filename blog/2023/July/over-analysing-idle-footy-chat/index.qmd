# Prelude

Since antiquity (or at the very least living memory), sporting data have been recorded, published and analysed for almost every professional sport known to man. In the modern day of analytics and social media it has reached a point where sports statistics have been recorded and opined on by teams, the press and your average punter alike. 

My beloved sport of *Australian Rules Football* (which I will henceforth refer to as "footy"[^footy]) is no different. Indeed some have even described the AFL (Australia's nation competition) as "the most data rich sport on Earth"[^data-rich-sport-source], although I would suggest that certain American sports such as baseball (i.e. [Moneyball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlKDQqKh03Y){target="_blank"}) have made far better use of their data.

[^footy]: As a Western Australian this is how I define it (along with the majority of Australia) but I am aware that this term is reserved for rugby league in New South Wales and Queensland
[^data-rich-sport-source]: [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_mePwh_02M){target="_blank"}


It is my observation that it is common for those watching or attending live footy to ask questions such as:

> What is the record for the most *[statistical category]*?

or 

> When was the last time *[obscure event]* happened?

I believe a contributor to this is that we are emulating what we hear on the broadcast commentary. The difference is that they often have a team of  [computer-type boffins](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxvNk03iqKigc9NKMjWOs2NvuRFRY8xRHn){target="_blank"}[^video-link-disclaimer] behind the scenes feeding them the answer. 

[^video-link-disclaimer]: The video linked here is unfortunately clipped from an American guy who kind of missed the point a bit, but it is also the highest quality clip I could find of this brilliant piece of commentary from BT ([Brian Taylor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_JCdK4ah78){target="_blank"} for the uninitiated).

> But what are us plebeians meant to do, bereft of such luxuries you might ask?

Well, a quick Google search will make short work of questions of a more trivial nature such as "which player has kicked the most goals"[^tony-lockett] or "which team has won the most premierships"[^most-premierships]. The more savvy among us may find answers to slightly more edifying questions by performing pro gamer moves such as

* Trawling through more obscure websites such as [AFL Tables](https://afltables.com/afl/afl_index.html){target="_blank"} to answer things like "what is the most disposal Zac Dawson had in a game"[^zac-dawson]; or

* Digging into the deep recesses of the AFL Live App to answer questions like "what is the record for the longest distance run in a game"[^telstra-tracker]

but some questions will still go unanswered.

```{r}
#| echo: false
tippy::tippy_this(elementId = "distance-image", tooltip = 'Also called <img src="longest-distance.jpg" title="Scully dominates!" class="img-fluid"> distribution.')

```

[^most-premierships]: [Carlton and Essendon tied on 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_VFL/AFL_records#Premierships){target="_blank"}

However if you are a [gadget-type operator](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxtEJxG9BEEvFMmGfpjSBWc4MtWPKwNTLW){target="_blank"}[^tipping-name] like myself, you will expand the number of footy stats questions you can answer immensely by accessing and manipulating the raw data yourself. There are of course a multitude of tools and approaches to this but in this post, I will be using R (my preferred programming language).

[^tipping-name]: My footy tipping username is *Gadget-type Operator* and I often use other [BT quotes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_JCdK4ah78){target="_blank"} for my username on other (even non-footy-related) accounts

## Apologies for the delay

I have been promising some people that this (my first) post will be "coming soon" for quite some time now. It has finally arrived and the main reasons for slowness are:

* Am a slow writer. I often have all the ideas in my head but when it comes to putting them into nice publishable words, it become a bit of a slog.

* The scope of this project expanded as I kept on branching off from the main mission in order provide additional background.


The R code and analysis itself did not take long at all, so the main areas I am looking to improve in the future are my writing efficiency and keeping the scope of my blog posts under control. However, it would feel like going against my style to avoid going down rabbit holes and off on tangents entirely, so there is still a balance to be struck there.

## A concrete example

I recently had the misfortune (as a West Coast fan) of attending a game live between the Sydney Swans and (not so) mighty West Coast Eagles with the following scoreline:

![](swans-vs-eagles-score.png "How embarrassing!")

In one-sided games like this, it seems to me that footy stats questions become more common than usual for two key reasons:

1. It adds something interesting to a game that otherwise lacks excitement

2. These games are often filled with large statistical anomalies that might set new records

If we also consider that it was two actuaries talking, it is safe to say that footy stats questions were flying left, right and centre on that gloomy (but not because of the weather) Saturday night at the SCG. The questions we posed did not just vanish into the aether either, I (with the idea of writing this article in mind) decided to record the more interesting (and doable) questions listed below:

> 
- What is the record for the highest scoring quarter?
- What is the record for the most individual goal kickers in a single game?
- What is the record for the most multiple goal kickers in a single game?
- What is the record for the most players kicking five or more goals in a single game (i.e. the most "bags")?
- Where does the aforementioned game rank among the most one-sided games?
- What is the record for the most clangers in a game?
- What is the record for the worst disposal efficiency in a game by a player?
- Has anyone won a Norm Smith Medal in their first season in the AFL?
- What is the record for the most unanswered goals in a game?*
- What is the school with the most AFL players on their list?*
- What city/town has the most AFL players relative to population?*
- Which player has the best goals to behinds ratio?*
- Have there ever been any undefeated seasons?*
- What is the worst win-loss record to make finals?*

::: {.callout-note}

## Disclaimer on the asterisk

I have put an asterisk next to questions that either: 

* cannot easily be answered by the methods I discuss below; or
* are too lengthy for this blog post (these may get their own blog post in the future). 

The remaining questions will be tackled using R below.

# Technical Background

## The `fitzRoy` Package

The first step in analysing AFL data is obtaining the data ("collection"). Our first thought might be to search the web for publicly available AFL datasets and APIs or even scrape the data from websites such as the [official AFL website](https://www.afl.com.au/){target="_blank"}, [Footywire](https://www.footywire.com/){target="_blank"} or [AFL Tables](https://afltables.com/afl/afl_index.html){target="_blank"}. But there is a more straight-forward way.


While most people now know Fitzroy as a trendy inner city suburb of Melbourne, filled with terraces and [over-priced croissants](https://www.lunecroissanterie.com/){target="_blank"}, it was once home[^bith-place] to the mighty  ([and now merged out of existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Lions#Brisbane_Bears_absorb_Fitzroy_Football_Club's_AFL_operations,_become_Brisbane_Lions){target="_blank"}) Fitzroy Lions Football Club.
  
[![](fitzroy-lions-logo.png "La Marseillaise!")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olKa-0H26k4){target="_blank"}

[^bith-place]: It is also (regrettably) the place of my birth but as a WA boy I don't like to talk about the fact that my parents happened to be in Melbourne when I was born.



We can obtain the data we need very simply using its name-sake, the `fitzRoy` R package. It abstracts away all the web scraping and API calls for us into a very helpful family of `fetch_*` functions.

So let's begin by loading the `fitzRoy` package and while we're at it, I will also load all the other packages I will be using.

```{r load packages}
#| message: FALSE
library(fitzRoy)

# Note that I generally avoid mixing dplyr and data.table at the same time
#   but the reason I have done with will become apparent later
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)

library(rvest)
library(stringr)

```




### `fitzRoy` Data Sources

`fitzRoy` provides access to a number of footy data sources[^FitzRoy] including [AFL Tables](https://afltables.com/){target="_blank"} and the [official AFL website](https://www.afl.com.au/fixture){target="_blank"}. Each data source has its own advantages and disadvantages, for example:

* [AFL Tables](https://afltables.com/){target="_blank"} has the entirety of AFL/VFL history (1897 to present) but lacks some of the more advanced stats.

* The [official AFL website](https://www.afl.com.au/fixture){target="_blank"} only has data from 2014 onwards but it also probably the most complete in terms of the advanced statistics it contains (e.g. centre bounce attendances[^CBAs]).

[^FitzRoy]: Up-to-date information on data sources can be found on `fitzRoy`'s [documentation site](https://jimmyday12.github.io/fitzRoy/articles/fitzRoy.html#data-sources){target="_blank"}

[^CBAs]: Centre bounce attendances (CBAs) are a commonly-used metrics in AFL fantasy, coaches often look at tools such as [this one](https://dfsaustralia.com/afl-cbas/){target="_blank"} to help with researching their trades.

Where possible we will use the AFL Tables data set as it has the full history of the AFL on it. However if we require stats that it is missing, we will simply have to adopt a different data source and caveat it by saying it is only for a subset of the full history of the competition.


The `fetch_*` family of functions from the `fitzRoy` package allow us to read the package. Consult the [documentation site](https://jimmyday12.github.io/fitzRoy/reference/index.html){target="_blank"} for a complete list of all the available functions. Below we will get the data we need to answer our questions:

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
player_stats_afltables <- fitzRoy::fetch_player_stats_afltables(season = 1897:2023)
results_afltables <- fitzRoy::fetch_results_afltables(season = 1897:2023)
```




::: {.callout-warning}

#### Being a good citizen

When sourcing data from `fitzRoy`, it is important to follow good data collection[^fitzRoy-good-practice] etiquette by only downloading the data you need and avoiding repeatedly downloading the same data over and over again. This prevents servers being overloaded and will mean everyone will get their data faster.

For example for the purposes of this blog post, I have saved the data in a local RDS file instead of repeatedly calling the `fetch_*` functions, I use `readRDS()`. The code for this is below (and the code above is not actually run but is cleaner for demonstration purposes):

[^fitzRoy-good-practice]: this topic is discussed on the `fitzRoy` documentation site [here](https://jimmyday12.github.io/fitzRoy/articles/fitzRoy.html#good-practices){target="_blank"}

```{r}
if(file.exists("data/player_stats_afltables.RDS")) {
  player_stats_afltables <- readRDS("data/player_stats_afltables.RDS")
  
} else {
  player_stats_afltables <- fitzRoy::fetch_player_stats_afltables(season = 1897:2023)
  saveRDS(player_stats_afltables, "data/player_stats_afltables.RDS")
}

if(file.exists("data/results_afltables.RDS")) {
  results_afltables <- readRDS("data/results_afltables.RDS")
  
} else {
  results_afltables <- fitzRoy::fetch_results_afltables(season = 1897:2023)
  saveRDS(results_afltables, "data/results_afltables.RDS")
}

## Finicky Details About Other R Packages

### Tidyverse versus `data.table`

In the R community, there is an [ongoing power struggle](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21435339/data-table-vs-dplyr-can-one-do-something-well-the-other-cant-or-does-poorly){target="_blank"} between using the Posit[^previously-RStudio]-backed [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"} and the ever-potent [`data.table`](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/){target="_blank"}.

[^previously-RStudio]: [formally known as RStudio](https://posit.co/blog/rstudio-is-becoming-posit/){target="_blank"} ([RIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtMzTGfs-fc){target="_blank"})

As to not unsettle people who prefer either `dplyr` (and the tidyverse) or `data.table`, I have written code in both packages as to not alienate anyone[^base-r-dig]. Where relevant, I have used a tabbed layout to allow the reader to see both for their convenience. As my personal preference for readability is the tidyverse, I will place this code in the first tab.

[^base-r-dig]: note that I have not written a `base` R dataframes version because I can see arguments for using both tidyverse and `data.table` but `base` R `data.frames` will probably cause more pain than they are worth (there is a reason that tidyverse and `data.table` exist)

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Tidyverse

Note that the code below is somewhat redundant as the `fitzRoy` package follows the [tidyverse philosophy](https://jimmyday12.github.io/fitzRoy/CONTRIBUTING.html){target="_blank"} and returns [tibbles](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"}. However this is add the `_tb` suffix[^tb-abbreviation] to distinguish it from the `data.table` code.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
player_stats_afltables_tb <- as_tibble(player_stats_afltables)
results_afltables_tb <- as_tibble(results_afltables)
```

[^tb-abbreviation]: an abbreviation of "tibble"


#### `data.table`

Henceforth, all `data.table` code will use the `_dt` suffix[^dt-abbreviation] as to distinguish it from the tidyverse code.

```{r}
#| message: FALSE
player_stats_afltables_dt <- as.data.table(player_stats_afltables)
results_afltables_dt <- as.data.table(results_afltables)
```

[^dt-abbreviation]: an acronym of "data.table"

:::


#### Adoption of the Native Pipe Operator (`|>`)

The so-called *pipe operator* (`%>%`) of the [`magrittr`](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"} package has been a core staple of tidyverse since its inception but since the R core team introduced the so-called *native pipe* (`|>`) to `base` R (in version [4.1](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/new-features-r410-pipe-anonymous-functions/){target="_blank"}[^function-shorthand]), this has led to a split in adoption. There are some nuances in its usage[^future-pipe-post] but it overall behaves in a similar way to the `magrittr` pipe and has [less overhead (and is therefore faster)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67633022/what-are-the-differences-between-rs-new-native-pipe-and-the-magrittr-pipe){target="_blank"}. While the native pipe was initially missing some of the key features of the `magrittr` pipe, new features[^pipe-features] have been added to it that (in my mind) mean that it might have even surpassed the `magrittr` pipe.


While I have tried to appease people in both the tidyverse and `data.table` camps, I will not be re-writing my code more than once with such as minor syntactic difference as the pipe I use. I will therefore be dragging all my tidyverse-using readers kicking and screaming into the R 4.1 world by adopting the native pipe (`|>`) in my tidyverse code.

> Note that the common RStudio shortcut, `Ctrl+Shift+M` can be changed from the `magrittr` pipe (`%>%`), which is still the default, to the native pipe (`|>`).

[^function-shorthand]: another cool thing introduced in this version of R was so-called function shorthand (`\()`), see `help("function")` for more details

[^future-pipe-post]: I may even cover these in a future blog post

[^pipe-features]: In R version 4.2, the `_` symbol was added as a placeholder character and in R version 4.3, extractions using the `$` symbol are now allowed



### Webscraping package

While the majority of our data will be sourced using the `fitzRoy` package, a small amount of data (namely Norm Smith medalists, which are outside of the scope of `fitzRoy`) will require us to perform some bespoke web scraping. This will be performed using the `rvest` package (loaded [above](#cb1)).


# Figuring Out the Answers

In this section I will provide my working using R for each of the [aforementioned questions](#a-concrete-example).

> Place the swans games for these stats where relevant. look at the least remarkable game it is on part with (e.g. for individual goal kickers if it seems notable)

## Preliminary Data Work

### Finding the Infamous Game

Let's begin with the simple exercise of obtaining the match ID for the [aforementioned](#a-concrete-example) Swans versus Eagles game.

To begin with, let's scrutinise the results data figure out what we have to work with.


```{r}
str(results_afltables)
```


Based on the above we can use a combination of the `Date` (or combination of `Season` and `Round`), `Home.Team` and `Away.Team` fields to uniquely describe the match and thus obtain it's unique `Game` id.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Tidyverse


```{r}
(
  results_afltables_tb |> 
    filter(Season == 2023, Round == "R15", Home.Team == "Sydney", 
           Away.Team == "West Coast") |> 
    pull(Game) ->
    infamous_game_id_tb
)

```


#### `data.table`


```{r}
(
  infamous_game_id_dt <- results_afltables_dt[
    Season == 2023 & Round == "R15" & Home.Team == "Sydney" & 
      Away.Team == "West Coast", 
    Game
    ]
)

# confirming:
identical(infamous_game_id_tb, infamous_game_id_dt)

```
:::

We can henceforth use this game ID whenever relevant to rank the swans.

### Flattening the Data

While inspecting the `results_afltables_dt` we may not that certain key match-level information (e.g. quarter-by-quarter scores) for answering some of our question is missing from it. As it turns out, this data is actually available on the `player_stats_afl_tables` data (one row per player per match) instead. Thus, we will create a 'flattened' version of `player_stats_afl_tables` that provide match-level field.


First, let's take a look at the `player_stats_afl_tables` dataset to determine which fields are player-level and which are match-level.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Code


```{r}
#| eval: false
str(player_stats_afltables)
```

Note that the output has been placed into another tab as it is rather long.

#### Output



```{r}
#| echo: false
str(player_stats_afltables)
```

:::


Inspecting the fields and using some knowledge of the game, we can determine that the following fields are player-level:

```{r}
player_level_fields <- c(
  "First.name", "Surname", "ID", "Jumper.No.", "Playing.for", "Kicks", "Marks", 
  "Handballs", "Goals", "Behinds", "Hit.Outs", "Tackles", "Rebounds", "Inside.50s", 
  "Clearances", "Clangers", "Frees.For", "Frees.Against", "Brownlow.Votes", 
  "Contested.Possessions", "Uncontested.Possessions", "Contested.Marks", 
  "Marks.Inside.50", "One.Percenters", "Bounces", "Goal.Assists", "Time.on.Ground..",
  "Substitute"
  )

match_level_fields <- setdiff(colnames(player_stats_afltables), player_level_fields)

```

We can now safely group by the `match_level_fields` below:

### Comparing to the Swans Eagles Game

While the swans scored heavily in the aforementioned game, it was not loaded so heavily in any particular so they are not really close to the highest scoring quarters. However, their third quarter score of 11 goals 5, 71 made it into the top ten of their highest scoring quarters. I actually didn't need to run any R code to find this out as there is a page on AFL tables that summarises quarter score records [here](https://afltables.com/afl/teams/swans/qh.html){targer = "_blank"}.

This illustrates the fact that sometimes you need to stray outside of fitzRoy but it give most of the data you could ever want.

### Background

The norm smith medal is award to the player adjudged best a field (best on ground) in the Grand Final.

The Norm Smith was first instituted in 1979 and prior to this, there was no official award given. However there is a source someone has provided of who they (and the media of the day) adjudged as being.

While as a Western Australian, I would have no qualms with discarding the older, exclusively Victorian seasons, if not for the fact more data available is always nice (even if it is of more dubious quality).
