I am an Associate of Institute of Actuaries of Australia (AIAA) with a technical inclination. I am currently taking an 18 month leave of absence from my job as an Actuarial Analyst at Finity Consulting in order to spend more time on my actuarial studies (to become a fellow), my family and personal projects.\n\nI have built this website as a fun project. I would like to use it to chronicle some of my side projects while I am taking my leave of absence. \n\n## What to Expect\n\nThe content of this site will mix and match combinations of some of my particular interests/skills listed below:\n\n  * Tools/Languages:\n    \n      - R\n      - VBA\n      - Excel\n      - $\\LaTeX$\n    \n  * Methods:\n  \n      - Statistics\n      - Data Science (Collection, Visualisation, Modelling)\n      - Mathematics\n  \n  * Applications:\n  \n      - Sport (Australian Rules Football, Cricket)\n",
