I am an Associate of Institute of Actuaries of Australia (AIAA). I am currently taking an 18 month leave of absence from my job as an Actuarial Analyst at Finity Consulting in order to spend more time on my actuarial studies (to become a fellow), my family and personal projects.\n\nI have built this website as a fun project. I would like to use it to chronicle some of my side projects while I am taking my leave of absence. I enjoy these project for their own sake and the main benefit I get out of them is learning and the satisfaction of building something cool. I hope that this website will provide me with further motivation to work on these projects (as well as being an enjoyable project in and of itself).\n\n### My interests\n\nThe content of this site will mix and match combinations of some of my particular interests/skills listed below:\n\n  * Tools/Languages: R,  VBA, Excel, $\\LaTeX$\n    \n  * Methods:  Statistics, Data Science (Collection, Visualisation, Modelling), Mathematics\n  \n  * Applications: Sport (Australian Rules Football, Cricket)\n\n:::\n\n\n# Contents\n\n* [goals](Goals): keeping track of my goals (prospective) and achievements (retrospective) as well as failure/road blocks along the way.\n\n* [blog](Blog): articles about my person projects and things that interest me.\n\n\n# Colophon\n\n> This section is inspired by the [section](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro.html#colophon){target=\"_blank\"} of the same name in Hadley Whickham's *[R For Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz){target=\"_blank\"}* (I am unaware of where the concept originally came from).\n\nThis website is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org){target=\"_blank\"}'s [static website generator](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/){target=\"_blank\"}.
