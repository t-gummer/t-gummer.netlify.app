I would also like to include my *failures* here as to break away from only showing successes (as one might on a resume or social media). I would like to do this as a reminder that not all ventures succeed but it is from failures that we often learn the most and without risking failure, we will never dare to do anything bold.\n\n\nMake it since graduating high school so no need to go too far back.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(googlesheets4)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# ss <- googlesheets4::gs4_get(\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kRK0zWsGz7GOHhtWSaV_9SlZ2zRxns_pVEh4YMJtsLQ/edit#gid=0\")\n# goals_tb <- googlesheets4::read_sheet(ss, sheet = \"Goals\")\n# groups_tb <- googlesheets4::read_sheet(ss, sheet = \"Groups\")\n```\n:::",
