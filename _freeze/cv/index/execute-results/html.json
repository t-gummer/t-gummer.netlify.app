It uses the beautiful [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV){target=\"_blank\"} template which I previously used in pure $\\LaTeX$.\n\n### Sharing\n\nIt is currently in a private repository on GitHub as it has some private information in it. There is also a visually consistent template for writing (cover) letters as well. I am happy to share the code with anyone who is interested. It probably is best suited to those familiar with $\\LaTeX$, R and Excel[^2].\n\nIn the future I may make a clean template in a public repository to share with an accompanying blog post on how to use the template.\n\n[^1]: Note that the [linked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMlRAiQUdD8){target=\"_blank\"} YouTube video does not use Excel but I do.\n\n[^2]: I am not sure how large the intersection between these skill sets is but I personally find the workflow and resulting look very satisfying.\n",
