  Those who have seen me recently may have noticed that I currently look rather diffierent to this photo. It was taken in April 2021 which was the last time I had a haircut and it is also the most recent (and only) professional photo which has been taken of me since high school (although some have suggested that it looks like a school photo anyway).

## Welcome to my website!


You have reached the personal website of **Tim Gummer**. I am an Associate of Institute of Actuaries of Australia (AIAA). I am currently taking an 18 month leave of absence from my job as an Actuarial Analyst at Finity Consulting in order to spend more time on my actuarial studies (to become a fellow), my family and personal projects.

I have built this website as a fun project. I would like to use it to chronicle some of my side projects while I am taking my leave of absence. 

### What to Expect

  * Tools/Languages:
