# Welcome to my website!

You have reached the personal website of **Tim Gummer**. I am an Associate of Institute of Actuaries of Australia (AIAA) with a technical inclination. I am currently taking an 18 month leave of absence from my job as an Actuarial Analyst at Finity Consulting in order to spend more time on my actuarial studies (to become a fellow), my family and personal projects.

I have built this website as a fun project. I would like to use it to chronicle some of my side projects while I am taking my leave of absence. 

## What to Expect

The content of this site will mix and match combinations of some of my particular interests/skills listed below:

  * Tools/Languages:
