# Goals

On this page I intend on listing my past, present and future goals. I would also like to include my *failures* here as to break away from only showing successes (as one might on a resume or social media). I would like to do this as a reminder that not all ventures succeed but it is from failures that we often learn the most and without risking failure, we will never dare to do anything bold.


Make it since graduating high school so no need to go too far back.

```{r}
library(googlesheets4)
library(dplyr)

```


```{r}
# ss <- googlesheets4::gs4_get("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kRK0zWsGz7GOHhtWSaV_9SlZ2zRxns_pVEh4YMJtsLQ/edit#gid=0")
# goals_tb <- googlesheets4::read_sheet(ss, sheet = "Goals")
# groups_tb <- googlesheets4::read_sheet(ss, sheet = "Groups")

```
